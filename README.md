## Why
Our main goal with this project is a feature complete server application.
We like you to be focused on your business and not spending hours in project configuration.

Try it!! We are happy to hear your feedback or any kind of new features.

## Features

## Getting Started
### Step 1:  Set up the Development Environment
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
* on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

Install yarn globally
```
npm install yarn -g
```

Install a MySQL database.

> If you work with a mac, we recommend to use homebrew for the installation.

### Step 2: Create new Project
Fork or download this project. Configure your package.json for your new project.

Then copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. In this file you have to add your database connection information.

Create a new database with the name you have in your `.env`-file.

Then setup your application environment.
```
nps setup
```

> This installs all dependencies with yarn. After that it migrates the database and seeds some test data into it. So after that your development environment is ready to use.

### Step 3: Serve your App
Go to the project dir and start your app with this npm script.
```
nps serve
```

> This starts a local server using `nodemon`, which will watch for any file changes and will restart the sever according to these changes.
> The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

### Step 4: Create a new Resource
Go to the project dir and hit this command in your terminal.
```
npm run console make:resource
```

Apply the same information like you see in the screenshot below.

![console](console.png)

> With that you just have created a complete new endpoint in your api for the resource pets.

Normally a pet belogns to a user, so we have to add the relationship between users an pets. Open the created migration file and replace the user property with these lines.
```
table.integer('user_id').unsigned();
table.foreign('user_id').references('id').inTable('users').onDelete('cascade');
```

Next we have to add this relationship also in the pets model.
```
public user(): User {
    return this.belongsTo(User);
}
```

> The relationship between the users and pets are set and ready. So you can migrate your database with `npm run db:migrate`

### Step 5: Create a Seeder
To seed some cute pets we need a smart factory. So open the ./src/database/factories/index.ts and add this code.
```
/**
 * PET - Factory
 */
factory.define(Pet, (faker: Faker.FakerStatic, args: any[]) => {
    const type = args[0];
    return {
        name: faker.name.firstName(),
        type: type || 'dog',
        userId: factory.get(User).returning('id')
    };
});
```

> This factory helps us to create a fake pet to seed to the database.

Run this command in your terminal and call the new seeder `create pets`.
```
npm run console make:seed
```

Open the file and place this code into it.
```
await factory.get(Pet)
    .create(10);
```

> Now we can seed some nice cats into the database with `npm run db:seed`.

> That was easy! Now its your turn to make something great out of it.

## Scripts / Tasks
All script are defined in the package.json file, but the most important ones are listed here.

### Install
* Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

### Linting
* Run code quality analysis using `nps lint`. This runs tslint.
* There is also a vscode task for this called `lint`.

### Tests
* Run the unit tests using `npm test` (There is also a vscode task for this called `test`).
* Run the e2e tests using `nps test:e2e` and don't forget to start your application and your [Auth0 Mock Server](https://github.com/hirsch88/auth0-mock-server).

### Running in dev mode
* Run `nps serve` to start nodemon with ts-node, to serve the app.
* The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

### Build a docker image 
* First you need ssh permission to git+ssh://git@git.netlogistik.com:tp/bookshelf-fork.git#fix-mssql 
* Then to build the docker image just type
* docker build -t tp:beta --build-arg ssh_prv_key="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)" --build-arg ssh_pub_key="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" .
* To run the docker image withing the port exposed just type:
* docker run -p 49160:3000 -d tp:beta

### Building the project and run it
* Run `nps build` to generated all JavaScript files from the TypeScript sources (There is also a vscode task for this called `build`).
* To start the builded app located in `dist` use `npm start`.

### Database
* Run `nps db:migrate` to migrate schema changes to the database
* Run `nps db:migrate:rollback` to rollback one migration
* Run `nps db:seed` to seed sample data into the database
* Run `nps db:reset` to rollback all migrations and migrate any migration again

### Console
* To run your own created command enter `npm run console <command-name>`.
* This list all your created commands `npm run console:help`.

### Scaffolding Commands
All the templates for the commands are located in `src/console/templates`.

* `npm run console make:resource <file>` - Generates a controller, service, requests, repo, model and a migration with CRUD operations.
* `npm run console make:controller <file>` - Generates a controller.
* `npm run console make:service <file>` - Generates a service.
* `npm run console make:repo <file>` - Generates a repository.
* `npm run console make:model <file>` - Generates a model with the props and configurations.
* `npm run console make:middleware <file>` - Generates a basic middleware.
* `npm run console make:request <file>` - Generates a basic request.
* `npm run console make:listener <file>` - Generates a basic listener.
* `npm run console make:exception <file>` - Generates a basic exception.
* `npm run console update:targets <file>` - Reads all the API files and generate a new `constants/Targets.ts` file out of it.

**Example**
```
$ npm run console make:controller auth/auth
// -> creates `api/controllers/auth/AuthController.ts

$ npm run console make:model user
// -> creates `api/models/User.ts
```

## IoC
Our IoC automatically looks through the `controllers`, `listeners` , `middlewares`, `services`,
`repositories` and `models` folders in `src/api/` for files to bound automatically into the IoC - Container, so you have nothing to do.

**However it is very important to keep the naming right, because otherwise our IoC will not find your
created files!!**

## Using the debugger in VS Code
Just set a breakpoint and hit `F5` in your Visual Studio Code.

## API Routes
The route prefix is `/api` by default, but you can change this in the .env file.

| Route       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **/api/info**   | Shows us the name, description and the version of the package.json |
| **/api/docs**   | This is the Swagger UI with our API documentation |
| **/status** | Shows a small monitor page for the server |
